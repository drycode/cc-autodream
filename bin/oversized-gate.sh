# Issue #12 measurement gate: what share of oversized transcripts still failed to triage?
#
# The gate is a trailing-window judgment: size failures divided by oversized sessions
# that have no silent, provider, or unclassified failure. A sustained share >= 5% over
# a week opens #12. run.sh records one night at a time, and an old runner (#29) may omit
# the counters, so this recomputes the window from sidecars, findings, and .err artifacts.
#
# It reads only artifacts. No model calls, no network, safe to re-run.
#
# Usage:
#   oversized-gate.sh                       # trailing 7 dated dirs under the findings root
#   oversized-gate.sh --days 14             # trailing 14
#   oversized-gate.sh <findings-dir>...     # exactly these dirs
#
# Environment:
#   AUTODREAM_DIR         default: $HOME/.claude/autodream
#   AUTODREAM_SLIM_BYTES  oversized threshold, matches run.sh   default: 262144

# The install dir is not the only place to look, for the same reason run.sh has a

# so merging a branch swaps the script those links point at instantly while a NEW
# library link does not exist until install.sh is re-run. `cd -P` resolves a
# symlinked DIRECTORY but not a symlinked FILE, so $HERE is the install dir every
# time and this script stopped working entirely during that window — on the one
# tool whose whole purpose is recomputing the #12 gate from artifacts after a
# runner problem. Walk this script's own symlink chain to find the repo's bin/.
