# Find (and optionally delete) autodream's OWN session transcripts.
#
# Every `claude --print` worker autodream spawns used to persist its own session
# JSONL into ~/.claude/projects/-Users-<you>/. The next night's run would then
# triage those as if they were real sessions — ~190 self-generated files/night,
# ~90% of the corpus, pure noise and wasted model spend. run.sh now passes
# --no-session-persistence so new runs leave no full transcript, and now runs workers
# from an isolated cwd so even the residual AI-title stub lands in a bucket run.sh
# wipes. Older runs predating those fixes still littered the real session bucket with
# both full transcripts AND one-line ai-title stubs; this script cleans up both and is
# the single source of truth for the "is this one of ours?" predicate (run.sh
# calls `--filter`).
#
# Usage:
#   prune-self-sessions.sh                 # list self-sessions under $PROJECTS_DIR (dry run)
#   prune-self-sessions.sh --delete        # delete them
#   prune-self-sessions.sh --quiet         # just the summary line, no per-file paths
#   prune-self-sessions.sh /path/projects  # scan a specific projects dir
#   prune-self-sessions.sh --filter        # stdin: session paths; stdout: only NON-self ones
#   prune-self-sessions.sh --is-self F     # exit 0 if F is one of ours, 1 if not
#
# Env:
#   PROJECTS_DIR   default $HOME/.claude/projects

# A session is autodream's own when its FIRST user turn is one of our inlined
# prompts. Anchored to the start of the message content so a human session that
# merely *discusses* autodream (mentions SESSION_PATH= mid-conversation) is NOT
# matched. Covers both the current literal-path framing and the legacy KEY=value
# framing from earlier runs, on either transcript shape:
#   - Claude stores user content in a string:   {"type":"user",...,"content":"..."}
#   - OMP stores an array of items:             {"type":"message","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"..."}]}}
# The `(content":"|text":")` anchor matches both.
SELF_RE='"(content":"|text":")(Session transcript to analyze \(literal absolute path\)|Findings directory to aggregate \(literal absolute path\)|SESSION_PATH=|FINDINGS_DIR=)'

# The FIRST user-turn record, whichever shape the transcript uses. Claude persists user
# turns as {"type":"user",...}; OMP as {"type":"message",...} with a message object whose
# role is "user" (assistant and tool records never match). `-m1` stops at the first record
# matching either shape, so callers always get the first user turn.
first_user_turn() { # $1 = jsonl path -> first user-turn record line (or nothing)
  grep -m1 -E '"type":"user"|"type":"message".*"message":\{"role":"user"' "$1" 2>/dev/null
}

# Second vector: an orphan AI-title stub. Claude Code's async title generation writes
# a one-line `{"type":"ai-title",...}` record into the worker's session bucket even
# under --no-session-persistence (which only suppresses the full transcript). These
# stubs carry NO conversation, so the first-user-turn rule above never catches them.
# We match them by the model-generated title, which paraphrases our L1/L2 prompts
# (e.g. "Analyze Claude session findings", "Triage coding session for findings",
# "Aggregate daily findings into report"). Safety comes from REQUIRING the file to be
# an orphan stub — no user turn anywhere. A real session is a single file containing
# its title alongside its turns, so it always has a user turn and is never matched;
# only headless calls that didn't persist a transcript leave a title-only orphan. And
# we still demand the title describe session triage / findings aggregation, so a real
# headless orphan about an unrelated task (e.g. "GCU Rush firmware development") is
# spared. Tuned against the real backlog: catches the L1/L2 title variants, spares
# terminal-tab-title stubs and unrelated work-session orphans.
