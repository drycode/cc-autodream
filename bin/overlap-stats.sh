# Deterministic, model-free global overlap pass for cc-autodream (GitHub issue #14).
#
# Cross-session computation: given a findings directory already populated with
# per-session *.stats.json sidecars (written by session-stats.sh's user_turn_timestamps
# field), compute how many distinct session pairs had a user turn within 30 minutes of
# each other ("multi-clauding" — the same human working two sessions concurrently).
#
# Definition (issue #14, unit pinned to seconds):
#   overlap_events        = number of DISTINCT unordered session-id pairs {A,B} such
#                            that some user turn of A and some user turn of B occur
#                            within WINDOW_SECONDS of each other. Pair-set semantics:
#                            a pair counts ONCE no matter how many turn-pairs qualify.
#   sessions_with_overlap = number of distinct session ids appearing in at least one
#                            such pair.
#
# Session identity: the sidecar's filename stem, i.e. the 12-char sha1 hash of the
# session path that run.sh already uses as the findings-file key (see hash_of /
# compute_session_stats in bin/run.sh). Stable per session, no need to re-derive it
# from session_path.
#
# Gating note: run.sh's noise gate (#7) decides per-session whether to skip the L1
# model call, but it runs AFTER compute_session_stats has already written every
# session's *.stats.json sidecar. Gated sessions' sidecars still exist and still carry
# user_turn_timestamps, so they STILL participate in overlap here — this stat measures
# concurrent human activity, not triage-worthiness, and this script has no visibility
# into (and does not care about) the gate decision.
#
# Advisor exclusion: sidecars with `is_advisor: true` are DROPPED from the corpus.
# An OMP advisor sidecar is a reviewer model tailing its parent session, so it inherits
# the parent's user-turn timestamps by construction and overlaps it 100% of the time.
# Including them made the stat read 90-of-90 sessions on 2026-08-19 and 629-of-629 on
# 2026-08-20 — a measure that fires on every session carries no information. This is
# the one exclusion the gate note above does NOT cover: gated sessions are real
# concurrent human activity that simply wasn't worth triaging, whereas an advisor pair
# is the same human activity counted twice.
#
# Nested-worker exclusion (#79): the same holds for a subagent or workflow worker. Its
# transcript is a separate file inside its parent's directory, with timestamps that sit
# inside the parent's span and inside every sibling's, so a 30-worker fanout paired every
# worker with its parent and with each other (2026-09-08 read "78 of 72 sessions"). A
# sidecar with `isSidechain: true` (a claude worker) or `nested: true` (an omp child) is
# dropped, so the stat counts concurrency between parent sessions. What it still includes
# is every gated top-level session, which the Activity snapshot's session total leaves
# out; PROMPT.md says so beside the figure.
#
# Usage: overlap-stats.sh <findings_dir> [window_seconds]   (default window: 1800 = 30 min)
# Prints a single-line JSON object {"overlap_events":N,"sessions_with_overlap":N} to
# stdout. Never fails the caller: an empty/missing findings dir yields 0/0.
