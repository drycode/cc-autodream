#!/usr/bin/env bash
# x-bookmarks.sh — pull recent X bookmarks so the aggregator can turn them into ideas.
#
# WHY NOT THE OFFICIAL API
#
# `GET /2/users/:id/bookmarks` has never been on X's free tier and needs Basic at
# $200/mo (checked 2026-08-02). So this speaks to the same internal web GraphQL
# endpoint the bookmarks page itself calls, authenticated with cookies the user pastes
# in once. That is the only mechanism that works, which is also why every browser
# extension in this space does the same thing.
#
# GROUNDING
#
# The request contract below — endpoint shape, bearer token, headers, `features` and
# `fieldToggles` payloads, the queryId discovery walk, and the response path — was taken
# on 2026-08-02 from displace-agency/x-bookmarks-exporter (src/api.ts), a working
# implementation, not from guesswork. Two things there are worth knowing when it breaks:
#
#   * The queryId in the URL path rotates whenever X deploys, so it is scraped from the
#     live JS bundle rather than hardcoded, and cached for a day.
#   * A wrong/stale `features` object comes back as HTTP 400 with a body that NAMES the
#     missing feature flags. That error text is self-documenting: read it and add the
#     named keys to FEATURES below. Do not go hunting.
#
# WHY IT CANNOT FAIL LOUDLY
#
# This runs inside the nightly pipeline. X changing a bundle path at 3am must not cost a
# night's report, so every path here exits 0 and always writes the output file — the
# failure IS the content, reported to the model as a `# x-bookmarks: fetch failed` header
# that PROMPT.md knows how to render. Nothing about a bookmark is worth an exit code.
#
# READ STATE
#
# `collect` merges the fetch into seen.jsonl and then emits every entry still carrying a
# null `read_on` — not just the ones this fetch returned. That matters after a failed
# run: the bookmarks were already recorded as seen (so incremental paging stops at them)
# but were never actually shown to anyone, and emitting only fresh finds would drop them
# forever. `mark-read` is what closes the loop, and run.sh calls it only after a
# non-empty report exists.
#
# Usage:
#   x-bookmarks.sh collect <findings-dir>    # write x-bookmarks.md + manifest
#   x-bookmarks.sh mark-read <findings-dir>  # stamp the manifest's ids as read
#   x-bookmarks.sh status                    # check the setup by hand
#
# Config (env; run.sh sources ~/.claude/autodream/config with `set -a` first):
#   AUTODREAM_DIR   default $HOME/.claude/autodream
#   X_CREDS_FILE    default $AUTODREAM_DIR/x-credentials — sourced as bash, keys:
#                     X_AUTH_TOKEN=...     (the auth_token cookie)

#   X_MAX_TEXT      per-post character cap in the report input   default 800

# A missing jq must NOT short-circuit the dispatch below. It used to `exit 0` right here,

# output file. run.sh's `|| log` never fired (the exit status was 0) and PROMPT.md treats
# an absent file as "feature not enabled, do not mention it" — so a user with working
# credentials and bookmarks piling up saw the section silently vanish from every report,
# with nothing anywhere distinguishing "off" from "broken". run.sh builds the launchd
# agent's PATH itself, so jq going missing there is a real configuration, not a theory.
