# Decide which launchd label this install owns.
#
# install.sh and bin/autodream-now.sh both need this answer, and while they
# derived it separately they derived it wrong the same way: any plist whose
# body mentioned run.sh was treated as ours. On a host that already ran
# one autodream install, installing another adopted the first one's label and
# rewrote that job in place. Nothing failed loudly - the second job ran fine every
# night while the first sat dead for 18 days (omp-autodream#14, the cause of
# https://github.com/STRML/cc-autodream/issues/60).
#
# Ownership is decided by the runner a plist actually invokes, not by the label
# it carries and not by AUTODREAM_DIR (a hand-written plist may have no
# environment block, but it always names its program).
#
# Usage: scheduler-label.sh <install-dir>
#   stdout  the base label, on every path; the -review and .ondemand siblings
#           suffix it
#   exit 0  label decided
#   exit 3  the default label is held by a plist running a different install.
#           stdout still carries that label. autodream-now only borrows it as a
#           namespace and always adds a per-install hash, so it ignores this
#           status. A caller that would WRITE the plist -
#           install.sh - must abort on this status instead of overwriting.
#
# Env: LAUNCH_AGENTS_DIR, PLISTBUDDY (tests point these at a sandbox).
